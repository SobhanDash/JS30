    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Neo', 'Sobhan', 'Adarsh', 'Trilo'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Trilochan';
    //above code are wrong!
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way: use slice() -> it returns a copy and leaves the original array untouched
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'ad'
    console.log(team2, players)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'tri'
    console.log(team3, players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Escanor';
    console.log(team4, players)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[1] = 'Kaizer';
    console.log(team5, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Sobhan',
      age: 30,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 19;
    console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 17, age: 20});
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We can also use object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    cap3.number = 9;
    cap3.age = 21; 
    console.log(person, cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const neo = {
      name: "Sobhan",
      age: 21,
      social: {
        twitter: '@Neo-Kaizer',
        instagram: '@n_e_o_009'
      }
    }
    
    const dev = Object.assign({}, neo);
    dev.age = 20;
    console.log(neo, dev)

    // dev.social.twitter = '@Neo_Kaizerr' 
    //console.log(neo, dev)
    //this can't happen as the function Object.assign() only goes one level deep. If we go any further it changes both the objects
    

    //to solve that we use JSON.parse(), although it gives a copy of the object and works similar to cloneDeep it might have performance issues 
    //JSON.stringify(neo) -> changes the object to string
    //JSON.parse() -> changes string back to object
    
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(neo));
    dev.social.twitter = '@Neo_Kaizerr' 
    console.log(neo, dev2)
